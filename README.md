# Volume Rendering
This is a project created by Alejandro Sans (sansalejandro@gmail.com) and VÃ­ctor Felipe for a Computer Graphic course (Universidad Central de Venezuela). 

This project show the technique displaying Volume Rendering with texture 2D. It has a transparency function that allows to hide and show the slice of the volume.

To load a volume, the file must be on the folder "files/Modelos". It should be a .raw file and the number of slices in each axis must be separated by an "x", as shown as follow:

- files/Modelos/Bonsai512x512x182.raw

* [FreeGLUT] 3.0.0-2
* [AntTweakBar] 1.16
* [FreeImage] 3.17.0
* [GLEW] 2.0.0

To compile in visual studio, the header files must be on a "tools" folder that must be created in the root folder. The headers should be included as follow:

    - tools/GL (FreeGlut and GLEW)
    - tools/AntTweakBar (AntTweakBar)
